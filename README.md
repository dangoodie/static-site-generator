# Static Site Generator

A **Static Site Generator** (SSG) is a tool that converts raw content files (such as Markdown and images) into a static website comprising HTML and CSS files. This project allows you to build static websites quickly, making it perfect for blogs, portfolios, documentation, and other content-heavy websites.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Converts Markdown files into HTML.
- Supports images and other static assets.
- Generates lightning-fast, secure, and easily hostable websites.
- Ideal for blogs, portfolios, landing pages, and documentation.

## ðŸ’¡ What Are Static Sites?
Static sites serve content that is pre-generated, meaning the website does not rely on a database or server-side scripting to display content. This makes them:
- **Fast**: All content is served as pre-built HTML, reducing server-side processing.
- **Secure**: Without a backend, there's no attack surface for malicious users.
- **Easy to Host**: Can be deployed on any static hosting provider.

### What Static Sites Can't Do
Static sites are not suitable for dynamic interactions such as:
- User logins
- File uploads
- Commenting systems
- Saving preferences

For these features, a dynamic site with server-side functionality would be required.
